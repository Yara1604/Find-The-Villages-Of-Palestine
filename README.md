# Find-The-Villages-Of-Palestine
Find the villages of Palestine quiz game ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¸

In the face of our peopleâ€™s struggles and ongoing attempts to erase our Palestinian identity and heritage, I felt compelled to create this game. 

The code is written in Python.
Required packages:
  - Turtle Graphics; for the GUI
  - Pandas; for importing the coordinates and exporting the "VillagesToLearn" file.
  - arabic_reshaper and bidi.algorithm; for displaying arabic text in the correct format.

Enjoy! âœ¨

PS: If you get stuck, write "Ù…Ø³Ø§Ø¹Ø¯Ø©" or "Ø³Ø§Ø¹Ø¯Ù†ÙŠ", then press on the file "VillagesToLearn.csv".
